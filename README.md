This project is a Bluetooth-enabled 2-axis SCARA (Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm) designed to draw on standard 8.5" x 11" paper. Created by Team 018, the robot receives vector-based drawings from a computer via Bluetooth and replicates them on paper using a mounted pen.

The system integrates precise motor control, kinematics, and embedded communication to bridge the digital and physical worlds—allowing users to “print” their digital sketches in real time. The SCARA configuration was selected for its accuracy, speed, and suitability for planar motion tasks such as plotting or handwriting.
